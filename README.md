# digitalWrite_shift_register_74HC595
This is a small script which allows you to use the shift register 74HC595 with a digitalWrite command. Its based on an Arduino Uno and written in C++.
You are allowed to use it for your project. I would appreciate it if you give me credits, but you don't have to. You are not allowed to  claim its your work or upload just my file under your name.
